Welcome to Kim's Sprint 3: Around the U.S!

For this project, I had 2 main goals. First, I learned how to use Figma and replicated this figma desgin (https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=7505%3A2&t=MZEXeVd4sPK5XFhg-0) without a brief of anykind. Second, I learned how to make the page responsive with media queries and different screen sizes without the layout breaking.

Additional items I learned and implemented included grid templates, importing and applying fonts, and buttons.
